# Roadmap for learning Embedded System (ES)

## 1. The C (C programming language, from zero to internal pointer variable)
[Motivation](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/u_eG4EaZ6uk)

 - C data types, variable, struct, type casting (char, unsigned, signed, long, double, â€¦)
 - Bit wise operations (AND, OR, XOR, Bit shift)
 - Function
 - POINTER (Pointer arithmetic, Array)
 - Static and Dynamic memory allocation/deallocation
 - Memory structure (Heap Segmentation, Stuck Overflow)
 - Code structure (Header files, Macros)

Books are pretty good source for learning C/C++ from scratch. [C++](/files/Cpp%20All%20in%20One%20for%20Dummies%20-%20FreePdf-Books.com.pdf)

## 2. Embedded C (Nothing but C, except few things)
Depends on what microcontroller you're using
 - Build tool chain
 - Macros
 - Memory layout

I have no available source for these topics. You shoud go into source code or search on internet for that. Sorry :(

## 3. Basics of electronics
### You really need to be careful with electricity to avoid damaging your devices

**Look for "[*why short circuit is dangerous*](https://www.google.com/search?q=why+short+circuit+is+dangerous&sxsrf=AJOqlzV3q4jRhGcILuO6tQbPVyesB3xqsg%3A1674445829404&ei=BQTOY-eoGM-I4-EPwbms0Aw&oq=why+short+c&gs_lcp=Cgxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAQAxgAMgUIABCRAjIFCAAQkQIyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDoKCAAQRxDWBBCwAzoHCCMQ6gIQJzoECCMQJzoECC4QQzoECAAQQzoICC4Q1AIQgAQ6CAguEIAEENQCOgUILhCABEoECEEYAEoECEYYAFDLBljYJWCCLWgDcAF4AYAB-gOIAYUQkgEKMS4xMS4xLjUtMZgBAKABAbABCsgBCMABAQ&sclient=gws-wiz-serp)"**

 - Voltage, Current, Ohms law
 - Usage of basic passive elements (Resistor, Capacitor, Inductor)
 - Usage of basic active elements (Transistors)

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@EngineeringMindset) is a very good teacher.

## 4. Microcontroller
[AVR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVR_microcontrollers) MCUs (microcontroller unit) are fairly simple and affordable.

Here's my training board for AVR Atmega32 MCU.
