# Roadmap for learning Embedded System (ES)

## 1. The C (C programming language, from zero to internal pointer variable)
        https://www.youtube.com/shorts/u_eG4EaZ6uk

 - C data types, variable, struct, type casting (char, unsigned, signed, long, double, …)
 - Bit wise operations (AND, OR, XOR, …)
 - Function
 - Pointer (pointer arithmetic, array)
 - Static and Dynamic memory allocation/deallocation
 - Memory structure (Heap Segmentation, Stuck Overflow)
 - Code structure (header files)

Books are pretty good source for learning C from scratch.
